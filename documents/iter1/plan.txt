Schedule Updates:

For Iteration 1, we planned the following:

Accounts (8 hours)
Big User Story: I would like to make an account.  There should be two sections, one for public information and one for information only visible to matched study partners.
Detailed User Stories:
	- I want to be able to set up a new account (4 hours | HIGH)  - COMPLETE
	- I want to be able to edit details on my account (3 hours | Medium) -  COMPLETE
	- I want to be able to link my account to my Facebook/LinkedIn (1 hours | LOW) - INCOMPLETE

Matches (11 hours)
Big User Story: I would like to see a list of all matches when both me and the study partner both accepted a match.
Detailed User Stories:
	- I want to be able to pass/fail potential study matches (5 hours | HIGH) - COMPLETE
	- I want to be able to see a list of my final matches (3 hours | Medium) - PARTIAL (UI is not ready yet)
	- I want to be notified when someone matches with me (3 Hours | Low) - INCOMPLETE

Viewing Profiles (10.5 hours)
Big User Story: I want to see more in-depth information on matched study partners.
Detailed User Stories:
	- I want to see a breakdown of a user's ratings (3 hours | High) - INCOMPLETE
	- I want to see a picture of the user (4 hours | Medium) - INCOMPLETE
	- I want to be able to see the user's information (3.5 | HIGH) - INCOMPLETE



We clearly weren't able to complete all of our tasks this iteration. Like with any project, there's a lot of overhead with ramping up. We were definitely way overambitious with our estimates, as we likely went way over for pretty much every story.
Some things that were added to our backlog, which didn't appear in our stories were:
	- Having persistent sign-in status
	- Logging out of your account
	- Cat photos as a placeholder for actual profile pictures (and because they're fun)
	- Input validation and password hashing on sign-in page


For Iteration 2, we'd like to do the following big stories:

Viewing Profiles (10.5 hours) (CARRIED OVER FROM Iteration 1)
Big User Story: I want to see more in-depth information on matched study partners.
Detailed User Stories:
	- I want to see a breakdown of a user's ratings (3 hours | Medium)
	- I want to see a picture of the user (4 hours | Low)
	- I want to be able to see the user's information (3.5 | High)

Rating System (16 hours)
Big User Story: I want a way to rate study partners, depending on how they performed during our session.
Detailed User Stories:
	- I want to be able to rate a past study partner (6 hours | High)
	- I want to be able to see what other people have rated a user (5 hours | Medium)
	- I want to see what my rating is on my profile page (5 hours | Low)

Deletion (7 hours)
Big User Story: I would like to delete my account, and have it actually deleted.
	- I want to be able to delete my account (4 hours | Medium)
	- I want to be able to log out (3 hours | High) - We actually did this in Iteration 1 because we needed it for testing purposes
