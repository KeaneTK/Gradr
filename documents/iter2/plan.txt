Schedule Updates:

For Iteration 2, we planned the following:

Viewing Profiles (10.5 hours) (CARRIED OVER FROM Iteration 1)
Big User Story: I want to see more in-depth information on matched study partners.
Detailed User Stories:
	- I want to see a breakdown of a user's ratings (3 hours | Medium) - COMPLETE
	- I want to see a picture of the user (4 hours | Low) - INCOMPLETE
	- I want to be able to see the user's information (3.5 | High) - COMPLETE

Rating System (16 hours)
Big User Story: I want a way to rate study partners, depending on how they performed during our session.
Detailed User Stories:
	- I want to be able to rate a past study partner (6 hours | High) - COMPLETE
	- I want to be able to see what other people have rated a user (5 hours | Medium) - COMPLETE
	- I want to see what my rating is on my profile page (5 hours | Low) - INCOMPLETE

Deletion (7 hours)
Big User Story: I would like to delete my account, and have it actually deleted.
	- I want to be able to delete my account (4 hours | Medium) - COMPLETE
	- I want to be able to log out (3 hours | High) - We actually did this in Iteration 1 because we needed it for testing purposes

We did a lot better on this iteration than the last. We left the lower priority tasks for later but we ended up having a lot of troubles trying to get the front-end tests to work, so more resources were put to that than we would have liked.


For Iteration 3, we'd like to do the following big stories:

Communicate 
Big User Story: I would like a way to communicate with matched study partners after we both accepted each other.  Preferably it would be a built-in chat window.
	- I want to be able to send a message to someone I've matched with (6 hours | HIGH)
	- I want to be able to see messages that someone I've matched with has sent to me (3 hours | HIGH)
	- I want to know if someone has sent me a message when I've been offline (4 hours | Low)

Settings
Big User Stroy: I would like to manage settings for my account like notifications and themes.
	- I want to be able to choose a background (4 hours | HIGH)
	- I want to be able to choose a colour theme (5 hours | Low)
	- I want to be able to customize notifications (6 hours | Low)

Picture:
Big User Story: I would like to upload a picture to my profile so matched study partners can recognize me.
	- I want to be able to set an image to be displayed whenever someone looks at my profile (6 hours | HIGH*)
	- I want to be able to see other people's profile pictures (4 hours | HIGH*)

*For the picture story, we'll need to do some research on how hard it is for us to store user images in our DB. We'll also have to see how much it costs to store these images in S3 or some other online service. We may scrap the Picture story if it is not feasible.
