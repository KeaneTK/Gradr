Schedule Updates:

	For Iteration 3 we planned the following:

		Communication (13 hours)
		Big User Story: I would like a way to communicate with matched study partners after we both accepted each other. Preferably it would be a built-in chat window.
				- I want to be able to send a message to someone I've matched with (6 hours | HIGH) 				- COMPLETE
				- I want to be able to see messages that someone I've matched with has sent to me (3 hours | HIGH)	- COMPLETE
				- I want to know if someone has sent me a message when I've been offline (4 hours | Low)			- COMPLETE

		Settings (15 hours)
		Big User Story: I would like to manage settings for my account like notifiJcations and themes.
			- I want to be able to choose a background (4 hours | HIGH)		- COMPLETE
			- I want to be able to choose a colour theme (5 hours | Low)	- COMPLETE
			- I want to be able to customize notifications (6 hours | Low)	- INCOMPLETE (notifications not implemented in earlier iterations)

		Picture (10 hours) (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
		Big User Story: I would like to upload a picture to my profile so matched study partners can recognize me.
			- I want to be able to set an image to be displayed whenever someone looks at my profile (6 hours | HIGH*)
			- I want to be able to see other people's profile pictures (4 hours | HIGH*)


		Due to co-op interviews and the CS games, the team didn't have as much time to complete tasks as originally 
		anticipated. This meant that we had to prioritize communication and settings, since they were deemed to be of
		higher priority than picture uploads. This means we will carry over picture uploading to the next iteration as 
		one of our final features implemented.

For the next iteration, we would like to implement:

	Picture (Carried over from last iteration)
	Big User Story: I would like to upload a picture to my profile so matched study partners can recognize me.
		- I want to be able to set an image to be displayed whenever someone looks at my profile (6 hours | HIGH)
		- I want to be able to see other people's profile pictures (4 hours | HIGH)

	Rejections
	Big User Story: I would like to see a list of all matches where I matched with a potential study partner, but they didnâ€™t match.
		- I want to see a list of people I wanted to study with, but who didn't match with me (4 hours | HIGH)
		- I want to ask the user to optionally provide a reason why they chose to not match with me (5 hours | MED)

	Leaderboard
	Big User Story: I want a leaderboard so I can compete with friends for most matches.
		- I want to see which of my matches have the highest matching ratio (6 hours | HIGH)
		- I want to be able to see where I rank on a 'global' scale (5 hours | LOW)
