Rating System:
I want a way to rate study partners, depending on how they performed during our session.  

Communicate:
I would like a way to communicate with matched study partners after we both accepted each other.  Preferably it would be a built-in chat window.

Viewing Profiles:
I want to see more in-depth information on matched study partners.  

IQ Test:
I would like all new applicants to do an integrated IQ test.  The results should be stored in the in-depth information section of the profile.

Accounts:
I would like to make an account.  There should be two sections, one for public information and one for information only visible to matched study partners.

Matches:
I would like to see a list of all matches when both me and the study partner both accepted a match.

Rejection:
I would like to see a list of all matches where I matched with a potential study partner, but they didnâ€™t match.

Picture:
I would like to upload a picture to my profile so matched study partners can recognize me.

Settings:
I would like to manage settings for my account like notifications and themes.

Deletion:
I would like to delete my account, and have it actually deleted.

Leaderboard:
I want a leaderboard so I can compete with friends for most matches.
